### ChroLens_Portal Core Feature: Turn Your PC into a "Lazy Pack" Launcher!

This program acts as your **PC startup assistant**, especially perfect for situations where you often need to open many things simultaneously.

It helps you:

* **"One-Click Launch":** Group frequently used programs, files, or shortcuts, and open them all in sequence with just one click.
* **"Close When Done":** After finishing a set of tasks, you can easily close all related windows at once, keeping your desktop clean and tidy.
* **"Auto-Memory":** Whether it's your group names, file lists, or opening order, the program remembers everything for your next use.

### "Group Launch": Customized "Scenario Modes" Tailored for Your Efficiency

The most thoughtful design of this program is its ability to let you **"bundle" various files and applications on your computer into distinct "scenario modes" based on different needs**. Whether it's documents, images, videos, music, or even various shortcuts (`.LNK` files), everything can be well-managed. Imagine this as an intelligent shortcut tailored for your digital life:

Project: Word + Reference PDFs + Web Browser
Designing: Photoshop + Illustrator + Assets Folder
Gaming: GTA V.. I?? / Fortnite + Discord + Strategy Guide Website
