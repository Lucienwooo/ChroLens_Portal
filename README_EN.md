### ChroLens_Portal Core Feature: Turn Your PC into a "Lazy Pack" Launcher!

This program acts as your **PC startup assistant**, especially perfect for situations where you often need to open many things simultaneously.

It helps you:

* **"One-Click Launch":** Group frequently used programs, files, or shortcuts, and open them all in sequence with just one click.
* **"Close When Done":** After finishing a set of tasks, you can easily close all related windows at once, keeping your desktop clean and tidy.
* **"Auto-Memory":** Whether it's your group names, file lists, or opening order, the program remembers everything for your next use.

### "Group Launch": Customized "Scenario Modes" Tailored for Your Efficiency

The most thoughtful design of this program is its ability to let you **"bundle" various files and applications on your computer into distinct "scenario modes" based on different needs**. Whether it's documents, images, videos, music, or even various shortcuts (`.LNK` files), everything can be well-managed. Imagine this as an intelligent shortcut tailored for your digital life:

* **"Work Mode":** You can set up **presentation PDFs**, **project Excel sheets**, **frequently used Word documents**, or even **company VPN shortcuts** all within the same mode. With a single click, all your work essentials will open in sequence, allowing you to quickly get into the flow, focused and efficient.
* **"Entertainment Mode":** When you want to relax, integrate **movie MP4 files**, **music player programs**, **shortcuts to favorite YouTube channels**, or **web shortcuts to online streaming platforms** into this mode. With a single click, all your audio-visual entertainment will launch in sequence, allowing you to instantly enjoy your exclusive leisure time.
* **"Study Mode":** Create a dedicated mode for your study plan, automatically opening **e-book PDFs**, **note-taking software**, **shortcuts to research paper folders**, or **web shortcuts to frequently used online courses**. This helps you quickly dive into knowledge exploration, saving time from opening each item individually.
