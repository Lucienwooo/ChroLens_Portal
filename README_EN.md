### ChroLens_Portal Core Function: Turn Your Computer into a "Starter Pack" Launcher!

This program acts like a **computer launch assistant**, perfect for situations where you often need to open many things simultaneously.
Busy, and getting busier.

It can:

* **"One-Click Launch":** Group frequently used programs, documents, or shortcuts. With a single click, open them all in sequence, no need to click one by one.
* **"Close When Done":** Once a set of tasks is complete, easily close all related windows at once, keeping your desktop clean and tidy.
* **"Automatic Memory":** Your group names, file lists, and opening order are all remembered for the next time you open the program.

### "Group Launch": Tailor-Made "Scenario Modes" for Your Efficiency

The most thoughtful design of this program is its ability to let you **"package" various files and applications on your computer into distinct "scenario modes" based on different needs**. Whether it's documents, images, videos, music, or even various shortcuts (`.LNK` files), everything can be managed properly. Imagine it as a smart hotkey tailored for your digital life:

* **When working on a project**: Word + Reference PDFs + Browser.
* **When designing**: Photoshop + Illustrator + Material files.
* **When gaming**: Emulator/MapleStory Artale/LOL + Discord + Strategy guide website.
