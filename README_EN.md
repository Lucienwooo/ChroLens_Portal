### ChroLens_Portal: Your Personal "Lazy Bundle" Launcher!

This app is like your **personal computer assistant**, perfect for those times you need to open a ton of stuff at once.

It helps you:

* **One-Click Launch:** Group all your go-to apps, documents, or shortcuts. One click, and boom – they all open up in order, no more hunting and pecking!
* **Clean Up & Close:** Task done? No problem. You can instantly shut down all the related windows from a group, leaving your desktop spick and span. Super satisfying!
* **Smart Memory:** It remembers everything! Your custom group names, file lists, and even the launch order are saved automatically, so it's all ready for you next time.

### "Group Launch": Custom Modes for Your Workflow & Fun

The coolest part of ChroLens_Portal is how it lets you **bundle all sorts of files and applications into unique "scenario modes"** based on your needs. Whether it's documents, images, videos, music, or even shortcuts (.LNK files), it handles them seamlessly. Think of it as a smart hotkey system tailored for your digital life:

* **"Work Mode":** You can set up a "Work Mode" that instantly opens your **PowerPoint slides (PDFs)**, that **important Excel spreadsheet**, your **main Word document**, and even the **shortcut to your company's VPN**. Just one click, and you're locked and loaded, ready to be productive and crush your tasks.
* **"Entertainment Mode":** Time to unwind? This mode bundles your **favorite movie (MP4 file)**, your **music player app**, a **shortcut to your go-to YouTube channels**, or even a **direct link to your streaming service's website**. One tap, and all your entertainment is up and running, so you can kick back and relax.
* **"Study Mode":** Boost your learning game! Set up a "Study Mode" to automatically open your **e-book (PDF)**, your **note-taking software**, a **shortcut to your research papers folder**, or **links to your online course platforms**. It gets you straight into study zone without wasting time opening everything manually.

You can name these modes however you like (e.g., changing "A" to "Morning Routine") and freely decide which files each mode includes, even adjusting the opening interval. This way, whether you're tackling work, enjoying leisure, or diving into studies, you'll start your digital journey in the most fluid and efficient way.
